# CVisionary Retrieval Service

A high-performance FastAPI microservice that acts as an intelligent intermediary for context retrieval. It orchestrates calls to the downstream **Embedding Service** to fetch semantically relevant text chunks, which are then used by upstream services (like a Generator Service) to build or edit resumes.

## Overview

This is a high-performance FastAPI microservice designed to act as an intelligent intermediary for context retrieval. It orchestrates calls to the downstream **Embedding Service** to fetch semantically relevant text chunks, which are then used by upstream services (like a Generator Service) to build or edit resumes.

## Technology Stack

* **FastAPI** - High-performance, asynchronous web framework
* **Pydantic** - Robust data validation and API schemas
* **HTTPX** - Efficient async communication with downstream services
* **Structured Logging** - Machine-parsable logs for monitoring and debugging

## Architecture & Core Concepts

This service sits between a client (e.g., a Generator Service) and the Embedding Service. Its main responsibilities are to abstract complexity and provide a resilient, task-oriented API.

        Client -- "(1) POST /retrieve/... (user_id, job_desc)" --> RetrievalService["Retrieval Service (FastAPI Endpoint)"]
        
        %% First call to Embedding Service to get the query vector
        RetrievalService -- "(2) POST /embed (with job_desc)" --> EmbeddingService["Downstream Embedding Service"]
        EmbeddingService -- "(3) Returns query_embedding" --> RetrievalService
        
        %% Second call to Embedding Service to get the chunks
        RetrievalService -- "(4) POST /retrieve/{user_id} (with embedding)" --> EmbeddingService
        EmbeddingService -- "(5) Returns relevant chunks" --> RetrievalService
        
        RetrievalService -- "(6) Returns RetrieveResponse to client" --> Client
    end
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Abstraction Layer

* Hides complexity of the Embedding Service's API
* Clients only need to specify what they want, not how to get it

For every request, the service performs a two-step orchestration:
1.  **Embed:** It first calls the Embedding Service to convert the incoming `job_description` text into a vector embedding.
2.  **Retrieve:** It then uses this newly generated embedding to query the Embedding Service for the most similar text chunks from the user's profile, using the correct namespace and filters.

### 3. Resilience and Error Handling

Communication with the downstream Embedding Service is wrapped in a **retry mechanism with exponential backoff**. This makes the system more robust against transient network issues or temporary server-side failures (5xx errors) from the dependency. It also provides structured JSON error responses for all exceptions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+
-   A running instance of the **CVisionary Embedding Service**.

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the service directory:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>/retrieval_service
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `retrieval_service` directory or set the environment variables in your shell.
    ```env
    # .env
    # REQUIRED: The full URL of the running Embedding Service
    EMBEDDING_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:9999"

    # OPTIONAL: The default number of chunks to retrieve if not specified
    DEFAULT_TOP_K="5"

    # OPTIONAL: Set to "DEBUG" for more verbose logging
    LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
    ```

5.  **Run the service:**
    The service is configured to run on port `8002` by default in most multi-service setups.
    ```bash
    uvicorn retrieval_service.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002 --reload
    ```
    The service will now be running at `http://localhost:8002`.

6.  **Access the API Documentation:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8002/docs` in your browser.

### Retrieval Endpoints

#### 1. Retrieve Full Resume Context

Fetches the most relevant chunks from a user's entire profile based on a job description. This queries the `profile` namespace in the Embedding Service.

-   **Endpoint:** `POST /retrieve/full`
-   **cURL Example:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/retrieve/full" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "user_id": "user12345",
      "job_description": "We are looking for a senior software engineer with experience in Python, FastAPI, and cloud-native technologies.",
      "top_k": 3
    }'
    ```

#### 2. Retrieve Section-Specific Context

Fetches the most relevant chunks filtered by a specific `section_id`. This queries the `resume_sections` namespace in the Embedding Service.

-   **Endpoint:** `POST /retrieve/section`
-   **cURL Example:**
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8002/retrieve/section" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "user_id": "user12345",
      "section_id": "exp-bullet-1",
      "job_description": "We need someone who can engineer real-time data processing pipelines.",
      "top_k": 2
    }'
    ```

-   **Success Response (200 OK for both endpoints):**
    The response is a `RetrieveResponse` object containing a list of `ChunkItem` objects.
    ```json
    {
      "results": [
        {
          "chunk_id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-g7h8-i9j0-k1l2m3n4o5p6",
          "user_id": "user12345",
          "index_namespace": "profile",
          "section_id": "experience",
          "source_type": "experience",
          "source_id": "0_0",
          "text": "Led a team of five engineers in the development of a cloud-native SaaS platform using Python and FastAPI.",
          "score": 0.912,
          "created_at": "2025-06-21T12:00:00Z"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### Utility Endpoints

-   `GET /health`: A simple health check endpoint for service monitoring. Returns `{"status": "ok", "service": "retrieval"}`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

The service provides structured JSON error responses for easier debugging by clients.

-   **400 Bad Request:** The request body is invalid (e.g., an empty `user_id` or `job_description`).
-   **404 Not Found:** The requested user was not found in the downstream Embedding Service.
-   **422 Unprocessable Entity:** The request body is syntactically correct but semantically invalid (e.g., `top_k` is out of the allowed range).
-   **502 Bad Gateway:** The Retrieval Service could not get a valid response from the downstream Embedding Service after retries.
-   **500 Internal Server Error:** An unexpected error occurred within the Retrieval Service itself.
